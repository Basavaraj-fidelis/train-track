Here’s the **full updated HR training system design** based on **your latest requirements**:

## ✅ HR Training Platform – Finalized Flow & Features

### 🎯 **Core Use Case**

* HR creates a course.
* Assigns it to a bulk list of employee email IDs.
* Employees receive email with login link.
* On clicking, user fills profile, completes course, gets certificate.
* HR monitors completion, triggers reminders, clears user list after deadline.

---

## 👩‍🏫 HR Flow

### 1. **Course Management**

* HR can create/update/delete courses.
* Each course has:

  * Title, description, deadline
  * Video(s), PDF(s), quiz
  * Validity duration (e.g., 3 months)

### 2. **User Assignment**

* HR clicks **“Assign Course”**
* Enters comma-separated email list:

  ```
  employee1@example.com, employee2@example.com
  ```
* System saves assigned emails with:

  * `status: pending`
  * `course_id`, `email`, `deadline`

> ✅ No user creation needed — only emails saved.
